# **Weekly Assignment I**

This is very similar to the workshop you did - yet another opportunity to put all this week's React material to work.

This one I would suggest styling as closely to the spec as possible. It is a figma file, so you should have all the resources you need to do so.

The figma file can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/NTr20ACcnMe7JHi5kwV7DE/Instagram-fiverr?type=design&node-id=14%3A5956&mode=design&t=omSud9hv86351V3Y-1).

PLEASE NOTE: only use the image on the right - the one with one image (guy in a suit) and one set of comments. The Figma on left is a future project (probably next week's). Sorry the guy who made these didn't separate them into different files and I haven't had the time to figure it out.
